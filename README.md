## Overview

This repository contains the **Dice Game**, a two-player dice game implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
Players compete to reach a total score of **100 points** by strategically rolling a die and banking points‚Äîwhile risking their current score if they roll a 1.
The game features a clean, interactive UI with visual feedback for the active player and winner, including animations for an engaging experience.

## üéØ Game Rules

### Objective

* Be the first player to reach a total score of **100 points**.

### Gameplay

* Players take turns rolling a single die.
* Each roll (2‚Äì6) adds the die's value to the player's current score.
* Rolling a **1** resets the player's current score to 0 and switches the turn to the other player.
* Players can choose to **Hold**, adding their current score to their total score, then passing the turn.

### Winning

* The first player to reach or exceed **100 points** wins.
* The winner's section is **highlighted** and **scaled up** for emphasis.

### New Game

* The **"New Game"** button resets all scores and starts a fresh game.

## ‚ú® Features

* Interactive and responsive UI with distinct player sections showing names and scores.
* Dynamic die display that updates with the rolled value (1‚Äì6) and hides when not in use.
* Visual feedback:

  * Active player's section is highlighted via the `.player--active` class.
  * Winner's section is styled with a **dark gray background (#2f2f2f)** and scaled up **1.5x** using `transform: scale(1.5)` with a **1.5-second transition**.
* Robust game state management for tracking scores, active player, and game status.
* Reset functionality to start a new game with cleared scores and initial state.
